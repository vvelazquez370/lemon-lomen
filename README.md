Christan Campos &amp; Veronica Velazquez - John's Lemon Jaunt!

MEMBERS:

MODS:

The character can sprint for a limited amount of time with SHIFT. A UI icon inidcates when it's ready, empty, and its recharging progress.
John Lemon gets points when he successfully passes a ghost without detection, with the score updating as a UI element.
Post-processing was added: anti-aliasing, bloom, tone-mapping, lens distortionn, vignette, color grading, are the primary changes made.

CHALLENGES:

The biggest challenge we had on the project was compiling and building. There were periods of time where we were working on the project on different computer setups, which made builds take hours. My laptop monitor also broke last minute after being cracked for weeks. Besides technology, the most difficult parts of the project were the outdated tutorial using different post processing technology.


FUTURE:

I am interested in working on this in the future. Already having a game created means I can focus on making modifications. I already love modding games, but most of them use uncommon coding languages such as Lua or Papyrus. Having a C# game to mod is a great help for learning that language for Unity.
